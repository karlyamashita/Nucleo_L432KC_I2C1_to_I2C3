This project will show how to create an I2C master and slave. I am using one development board, NUCLEO-L432KC, but you can easily use two different Nucleo boards, one that acts as the Master and the other board acts as a Slave.

See https://github.com/karlyamashita/Nucleo_L432KC_I2C1_to_I2C3/wiki for more information
